# Cinemafuse
As a third-party movie booking application, CinemaFuse's goal is to integrate movie ticket bookings from various cinema companies in Singapore. The app's concept is to allow users to browse and book movie tickets from every Singapore theatre with just a single app. It displays the film details as well as the date and time of the movie screenings. CinemaFuse is also able to provide the map location and direction of the specific cinema theatre using integrated Google Maps.
